# GPS 1.1 Version Control

* __What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?__

I don't know if there was any one topic that I was struggling with greatly prior to the GPS session. However, after the session I realized I could use more practice on fixing merge conflicts. This seems to be a very important skill especially when working with teams.

* __What concepts were clarified during the GPS?__

I don't think I fully realized the importance in the difference between 'git pull' and 'git fetch' with 'git merge'. Using 'git pull' is essentially a combination of fetch and merge. However, this is a less safe move when working in teams. Using 'git fetch' allows you to see the commits prior to merging them into your local directory, which is important in case there are bugs in the version of the code you are trying to merge. This acts as a stop gap, essentially giving you a chance to not merge the code.

* __What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?__

I asked both my pair and guide the difference between 'git commit -m' and 'git commit -v'. I generally write my git commit messages in the Sublime editor. However, using 'git commit -m' seems like something I will use in the future to write the messages directly in the command line.

* __What still confuses you about git?__

I am still not quite clear on how to roll back changes if an error is noticed in a particular version that is merged into the main branch. I will make sure to do outside research on this topic to gain a firm grasp on how to roll back changes.

* __How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?__

I really enjoyed my first pairing experience. I made the mistake of initially not wearing headphones, which caused a bit of annoying feedback for the other people in the hangout. I will make sure to remember to wear headphones at all times moving forward. After correcting for this, my pair and I gelled very well throughout the challenge and did not run into any major hurdles.
