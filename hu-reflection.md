**What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?*
'''
I wasn't struggling with much of the git concepts, because during the first 2 days of learning git it try to crash or make conflicts with git a few times and tried to correct it.  I also spend a lot of time on youtube watching a few videos about git during our phase 1.
'''
**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**
'''
The git fetch, git merge, and how to delete branches off the origin.
'''
**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**
'''
Before we started I ask where everyone was from, how are they doing today, are we doing it correctly.
'''
What still confuses you about git?
'''
I"m not confused about git anymore, git commands are cleared up by our guild.
'''
How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
'''
My first experience was very pleasent, our guild was very nice and friendly.  I hope to get her next time and the same cohort.  The guild and my cohort knew their stuff really well.  That helps my confidence in coding.
